# festival_scraping
April 2025:
This is a fun little project I started working on that pulls information from the web and updates me on
the availability and prices of festivals I like to attend. 
It uses very basic web scraping concepts; by utilizing the "amazing soup" python library, it pulls the html
information of designated website and displays all the information I need on selected festivals. It uses 
basic loops and functions. No OOP was needed it this project. 

Update May 2025: Currently contains Nocturnal Wonderland and HARD Summer
